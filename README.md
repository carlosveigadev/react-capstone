# **React & Redux** Capstone Project - **Pok√©mon Pok√©dex.**
 
This is a solo project at the end of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum of the React & Redux section. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications to improve and test the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program. The technical requirements of this project are::
1. The project is a single page application built with React and Redux
2. The data that was retrieved from the API should be stored in the Redux store
3. You should filter the data that you retrieve from the API using a Filter stateless component
4. Every page, the main page, and pages for each item, should have a unique route within the SPA
5. The project should be deployed and accessible online
6. Test your app using specific testing tools for the framework
7. Use CSS modules to style the React app
8. Use React Hooks for this app
